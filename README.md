# Why are my EGGS so expensive still?
Are eggs in the United States actually expense due to business costs, or is there another reason?
In recent years prices for groceries have been increasing.
Particularly, the average retail price of a dozen, grade A, large eggs in the U.S. have seen a 142% increase.
As a consumer of eggs, I wanted to conclude possible  contributors that affected my increase in grocery spending.
Bird Flu (HPAI) outbreaks happened in the US around February 2022 and March 2024(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. (2025, May 22). Highly pathogenic avian influenza emergency response. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-emergencies/hpai).

However as of June 2025, the average retail price is still trend above pre HPAI levels. This analysis aims to exam 
* US egg supply chain for possible disruptions.
* Unprecedend increases in demand and retail purchases.
* Sustaining scarity or limitions in egg production.
* Price manipulation and increased profits for egg manufactors and wholesellers.
