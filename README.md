# Why are my EGGS so expensive still?
Are eggs in the United States actually expense due to business costs, or is there another reason?
In recent years prices for groceries have been increasing.
Particularly, the average retail price of a dozen, grade A, large eggs in the U.S. have seen a 142% increase.
As a consumer of eggs, I wanted to conclude possible  contributors that affected my increase in grocery spending.
Bird Flu (HPAI) outbreaks happened in the US around February 2022 and March 2024(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. (2025, May 22). Highly pathogenic avian influenza emergency response. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-emergencies/hpai).

However as of June 2025, the average retail price is still trend above pre HPAI levels. This analysis aims to exam 
* US egg supply chain for possible disruptions.
* Unprecedend increases in demand and retail purchases.
* Sustaining scarity or limitions in egg production.
* Price manipulation and increased profits for egg manufactors and wholesellers.

### Cost of Goods:
* 2021 - 2022 
Feeding costs per dozen rose about 28%. The war bewteen Russian & Ukraine caused increased fuel
costs, transportation and fertilizers prices and strong export demand and restrictions further compounded the existing issues that contributed to near-historical low stocks-to-use ratios for corn worldwide and overall higher feed ingredient cost and price volatility.
Packaging and labor wages increased due to inflation and COVID related supply chain disruptions. 
Amortization costs increased as well since more hens were obtained through M&A's. 

* 2023 - 2024
 Total COGS dropped due to lower sales, bird flu.
 Feeding cost of hend also decreased. Reasons noted were to lower corn and soybean meal prices helped production costs stay low.
